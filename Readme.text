#Here we created the simple web server form using Golang and HTML

1  First we create a directory within our project called Form/ which will contain all of our websiteâ€™s static files.
-Form
    -Form.HTML

2 Create a server.go file for web server
 Here we define http.Handle() passing in our path and http.Dir() which points to our newly created Form/ directory.
